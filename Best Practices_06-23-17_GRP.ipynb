    "Reproducibility in research is the ability of the experiment to be re-run by the author or someone else and achieve the same result or results that lead to the same conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In computational research, the way to make the work reproducible is sharing the data, codes, documentation, and running those in the same environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a common structure to follow, using popular platforms, in order to achieve good reproducibility (Fig. 1):\n",
    "- Sharing/Distribution\n",

    "    - MRI, CSV, ...\n",

    "    - Create a README file to inform how to setup the environment and run the codes.\n",
    "    - Create a Workflow\n",
